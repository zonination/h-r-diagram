# Animated Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram with 119,614 datapoints

## About

Got bored with a lot of the Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagrams out there, so I made and animated my own using 119,614 data points in a star catalog.

Stars twinkle for two reasons:

* Aesthetics
* Reduces overploting

## Graphic

## Notes:

If you're going to play with this:

* Make sure you have FFMPEG installed
* the last line is optimized to work with unix-like systems (Linux/Mac, basically). If you have Windows, replace it with `DEL star_anim*.png`
* make sure the second line has the correct working directory under `setwd()`.

I'm told that this star catalog may potentially contain inaccurate information. [See comments here](https://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/433960/got_bored_with_a_lot_of_the_hertzsprungrussell/czfres5?context=3).
